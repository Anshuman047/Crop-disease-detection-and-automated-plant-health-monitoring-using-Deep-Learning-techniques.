# üå± AI-Driven Crop Health Monitoring and Efficient Irrigation Management System
*Automated Plant Disease Detection & Nutrient Deficiency Analysis with IoT Integration*

## Abstract

This system presents an agricultural evolution using artificial intelligence by introducing an automated crop monitoring and irrigation management solution. Combining microcontroller technology, Internet of Things (IoT), and deep learning, the system significantly boosts productivity and efficiency in modern farming practices.

**Key Features:**
- ü§ñ **Autonomous Line Follower Robot** equipped with USB camera for plant image capture
- üîç **Custom-trained YOLOv8 Model** for precise plant detection and localization
- üß† **VGG16 Transfer Learning** for disease classification and nutrient deficiency detection (N, P, K)
- üå¶Ô∏è **Weather-Driven Irrigation** using OpenWeather API for optimal water requirement estimation
- üì° **IoT Integration** with Raspberry Pi and Arduino Nano for real-time monitoring and control

The system empowers farmers with intuitive crop health monitoring and management capabilities, enabling early disease detection, precise nutrient management, and water conservation for sustainable agriculture practices.
